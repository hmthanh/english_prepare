Part C
Welcome ladies and gentleman to the local museum of fashion. Before we go up to the fashion exhibition close to the future I would like to show you some slides on the screen and say a few words about the history of fashion. I will also mention some of the important people in fashion. This will provide an introduction for you and will prepare you for the clothes that we going to see in the exhibition. As I'm sure you know nowadays fashion is something that almost everybody enjoys. People of all age groups and all incomes usually have an interest in what they wear. But this is only recently happened and I will tell you why. Until the beginning of this century it was only the rich who could afford to follow fashion. There were no factories to make many copies of the same article as Iraq today. Rich men and women wore trousers jackets and dresses which were made especially for them. This picture here shows a young lady being measured for a dress that she will have made by hand exactly how she wants it to be. Ladies because in those days were long and usually tight fitting and made of heavy material. However the new century the 19 hundreds brought new ideas. The important person at this time was coco Chanel he started making clothes in 1908 in Paris. Many people think she was the twentieth century's most important influence on fashion. Chanel love to wear loose fitting clothes and produce jackets and skirts which everyone admired. Here is a picture of one of her latest suits. Even today people still wear styles like this when they want to look smart. Young Paris design is all began to produce simple clothes and Scott started to get shorter. The only special clothes for playing sports also became popular in the early 19 twenties. Things like long shorts and tennis clothes started to become fashionable. Soon factories produce these new styles more cheaply and then many more people were able to enjoy a fashion. In 1947 after the second World War Kristen deal use all the new materials available to produce a fashion which was known as the new look. As you can see in this picture. He made skirt lengths longer again. Later in the sixties flower power and student fashion were popular. In London Mary quant introduced short skirts. These were worn with boots that went up to the knee. Look at the white shiny boots in this picture. And now we come to today's exhibition. Some of the clothes you will see today will be very different from anything which you have seen before. The exhibition aims to take a look at the sort of clues that we might wear in the next 50 years. Let's go inside and have a look at the exciting close to waiting for us. This way
