Test 8
Part A
Directions, you will hear 10 conversations between two people. After the second listening of each conversation, you will hear a question and there are four possible answers provided select the best answer to each question.
Question 1.
Look, I bought a new coat. It's by a famous designer. I forget who originally it was $1,525. But now that winter is over. I got it on sale for only $700.
Really, but I liked your old one.
I did too. But it was too small. And this one is very stylish.
Well, the new ones nice. I like that green color. And it half off. It's a real bargain.

Why did the woman buy a new coat?

Question 2.
Mr. Kim's flight should get in at three. It left at 11 and it's a four hour flight.
Do you want me to get him at the airport in the car? Or will he take the subway?
He said he take the subway downtown. He'll go right to his hotel then meet us for dinner later at the restaurant.
I hope he knows how to get to the restaurant from the hotel. If not, I guess he can always call one of us on our cell phones and ask for directions.

Where will Mr. Kim probably meet the speakers tonight?

Question 3.
Look, there's tuna on the menu. I've been craving tuna for a long time. Oh, but I see it's $35 Why does fish cost so much?
Well, it shouldn't cost that much. That's too expensive for seafood. Even if it is tuna. Maybe you should try something else. 
You're probably right. The shrimp sounds nice when the price is reasonable. I think I'll have that instead. 
Oh with lemon and garlic. That does sound good. I think I'll order the same.

What will the man get?

Question 4.
The train should be here in about five more minutes.
Good. I've been waiting half an hour. I was getting ready to walk.
Don't do that. It's too far. The train will be here soon.
I hope so. I don't like to get home at After Dark,
I know what you mean. Sometimes when I leave work, it's already dark out. It feels like I've missed the whole day.

Where is the woman going?

Question 5.
Please send this envelope by express mail. It has to arrive as soon as possible.
All right. I'll do it before lunch. As soon as I finished typing this report. Do you mind telling me what's in it?
You can take a look if you want. It's just a letter. And I haven't sealed it yet. Don't worry. It doesn't contain any confidential information. The only reason I'm in a rush to get it out is that I was supposed to send it last week. It's been sitting on my desk for days because I kept forgetting to look up the address.
Oh, just a letter. Well, anyhow, don't worry about it. It'll get there by tomorrow morning.

What is the woman doing now?

Questions 6.
Can we meet in my office on Tuesday morning?
I have a dentist appointment then. How about Wednesday?
I'll be at a conference all day. How about Thursday afternoon?
That will work out fine. I'll have my secretary send you photocopies of those contracts to look at before we meet.
Great, that will save me from having to read them in front of you. I don't want to waste any of your time.

Where will the speakers meet?

Question 7.
Did you hear that? Marc's starting a new job next week?
Yes. He told me. His old job just didn't pay him enough.
I know. He worked there for 13 years. And in all that time, they gave him only one or two raises.
He's lucky to have a new job then. But if I were he, I'd take a month's vacation before starting it.

How long did he work at his old job?

Question 8.
Okay, you're sending this envelope to Chicago, right? Does it contain jewelry, cash or any other valuables?
No, it's just photographs.
Fine. That'll be $7 for express mail or $3. Regular.
I'll pay for Express. That doesn't include insurance, does it? I don't need insurance. They aren't exactly originals. 
No, it's Extra for insurance. We only recommend insuring packages with contents over $50. Anything less than that isn't worth the trouble or expensive tracking.

How much would a woman have to pay?

Question 9.
What time would you like your wake up call tomorrow? Sir? Should I arrange it for 830? Again?
No. Make it 6:45. I have a breakfast meeting downstairs at seven. It doesn't take me much to get ready in the morning.
All right. And would you like to order dinner in your room tonight? I could have Samuel bring you up a copy of tonight's specials if you like,
No, thank you. That won't be necessary. I already ate a few hours ago. I'm going to go relax in the pool now. I'll be down in a minute to pick up a towel.

What is the man going to do now?

Question 10.
Mrs. Davis hears everything The board has to say. Mrs. Davis called she says she won't be here until 11. 
Her train must have been delayed again. 
I think so. Well, as long as she's here no later than one this afternoon.
Oh, yes. The meeting starts at one. She has to be here for that.
If for some reason she gets in later than one. We'll have to postpone the meeting until she arrives. It's crucial that Mrs. Davis hears everything The board has to say.

Why will Mrs. Davis be late?

This is the end of Part A
Part B
Directions, you will hear a conversation. After the second listening there are incomplete sentences and four possible options provided for each gap. Select the best option to complete the sentence.
You will hear a radio interview with a man who works on an international camp. Now we are ready to start. Listen carefully. You will hear the recording twice.
Hi there. on last week's program, we interviewed the man behind the idea of the International camps. So I thought that this week, you'd be interested to hear more about one of the camps, which will be held later this year. Over to you, Michael, thank you.
Yes, the camp is open to everyone between the ages of 18 to 23. You don't have to be a student. You don't even have to be employed. But you must be able to speak one foreign language in addition to your mother tongue.
Okay. And what about accommodation?
Well, the International camp organizers supply tents, which sleeps up to four people. But you are unlikely to know the people who you'll be sharing a tent with. The nationalities are mixed. So you'll be sharing with people who may not even speak your language sounds interesting.
Who does the cooking at the camp?
everybody is expected to help with the running of the camp. That means helping to prepare food, keeping the campsite clean and tidy and so on. The camp organizers are looking for people who couldn't get along with others, whatever happens?
And is there anything you need to take?
Well, as I've said, tents are provided. But you'll need to bring your own pillow, knife, fork and spoon. If you get chosen. You're also asked to bring along photographs, postcards, anything that shows some of the traditions and customs of your own country. Everything goes into an exhibition at the start of the camp, together with a huge map of the world showing the different countries people come from.
And is there any entertainment?
Yes, there is. Everyone helps to provide the camp entertainment. You are expected to sing dance or play something musical. It doesn't matter how good or bad you are. There is a space on the form to write down what you can do.
Sounds great fun. And what does it all cost?
Well, you have to find your own way to the camp. So it's up to you whether you fly cycle, walk, hitchhike or whatever. The charge for a week's camp is $300. But you'll have to change that into your own currency to get a better idea of the cost. You have to pay the full cost before you arrive. But you can pay in any currency you want. Or you can use a credit card if you have one. Right now for the phone number to ring its own one.
This is the end of Part B.
Part C
directions. You will hear a talk. After the second listening there are questions select the best answer to each question.
Now we will begin Part C.
You will hear a man called Frank talking on the radio about looking for ships that sank at sea long ago.
Now we are ready to start. Listen carefully. You will hear the recording twice.
Frank, tell us about some of the ships you've discovered.
Well, there's nothing quite like finding your first own ship. It was 300 years old. It was just lying at the bottom of the sea. So it wasn't difficult to find. Most are covered in sand and rocks. But this one wasn't. I'm actually a teacher and not a full time diver. I dive in my free time, but I often get to them before the professional divers because I have good up to date equipment. And other thing that helps is talking to fishermen who tell me about their local area. I've even written a book about some of their experiences. At the moment, I'm looking for the gold from a ship called the sea bird. It was an enormous well built ship. And it was coming from Australia on a winter night in 1859. Everything was going fine until the ship reached the English coast when it crashed into some rocks in a very strong wind and sank to the bottom of the sea. It was carrying gold from Australia, and most of it is still at the bottom of the sea. My wedding ring is actually made from gold, which I found on an 18th century sailing ship. A friend of mine, another diver has already found 88,000 pounds worth of gold from different ships. He's now decided to give up his job and become a full time diver. My house is full of things like coins, bottles, and old guns. My wife is always complaining about the number of objects around the house. She says I should open an antique shop. But I love all these things. Anyway, in the end, I gave some things from my collection to museums, because I didn't want to sell them. But my wife still wasn't very pleased, I'm afraid as diving is a dangerous hobby. It's not a good idea to try to teach yourself. I'd advise anyone interested to do what I did. There are some excellent diving clubs like the one I joined, which run courses for beginners. It's best to do one of these before you go on a diving holiday.
