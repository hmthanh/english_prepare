now we will begin Part B
You will hear an interview with a teenager called Simon about going to an indoor climbing center that has a climbing wall.
Now we're ready to start listen carefully you will hear the recording twice.
Hello everyone today we're discussing adventure activities and I'm talking to Simon Bonito who recently went with his mum to an indoor climbing center. Simon what gave your mum the idea to take you there? 
Well last year my school had a trip to the center but I missed it because I was sick then recently she went with a friend and tried it herself and she loved it so after that she wanted to take me to 
And what did you think when your mom suggested going to the center? 
Well I knew I was OK at climbing we've been climbing on Holidays and I thought we'd do something similar at the center, I was really looking forward to it but then my mom explained that the wall was inside I wasn't so interested when I heard that I prefer being outside. 
But did you meet lots of people there? 
Well yes that was great it was early morning when we arrived and the center just opened so it was quiet but lots of people came later in the morning and for once I wasn't the youngest I'd expected it to be mainly young people there but there were people of all ages serious climbers mums with five year old and teenagers like me. 
So, what was the climbing wall like? 
Well luckily it had rocks of different sizes to help you climb so there was little chance of falling off and I'd imagined it would look high before you started to climb but actually it didn't seem that far to the top there were lots of really useful holes all over it too to put your feet in green ones for an easy climb red for more difficult. 
So, what was your first climb like was it easy? 
No the instructor showed us what to do and I'd thought I'd soon get to the top but I was the last to get there so I was annoyed with myself the instructor warned us it can be painful for your arms too but I didn't notice and I did improve. 
So, what did you learn from your visit? 
Well it was great to be with other people who all like doing the same thing and when I was climbing I had to think carefully where to put my feet before I moved so that's helped me to think first before I do things it showed me that i'm fitter than my friends who spend too much time on their computers. 
Well thanks Simon.
